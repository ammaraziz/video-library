# GTN Video Library

This repository hosts the GTN Video library 

## Events

We offer support for event organizers to create webpages for their events

For examples of past events using this setup, see our [Event list](https://gallantries.github.io/video-library/events)

## Adding an Event

We aim to make it easy for anybody in the Galaxy community to setup a course webpage for their event.

- [Example event page](https://gallantries.github.io/video-library/events/testevent/test-event.html)
- This page is generated from [this event definition file](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/gallantries/video-library/main/docs/events/testevent/test-event.md)

You can also use our [course builder](https://gallantries.github.io/video-library/course-builder) (in beta), to help you create this definition file.

Since the course builder is still in development, feel free to contact [Saskia](mailto:saskiahiltemann@gmail.com) for help setting up an event page.
